#           ---         Scopes and Namespaces Example           ---

#This is an example demonstrating how to reference the different scopes and namespaces, and how global and nonlocal affect variable binding:

def scope_test():
    def do_local():
        spam= 'local spam'
        
    def do_nonlocal():
        nonlocal spam
        spam = 'nonlocal spam'
        
    def do_global():
        global spam
        spam = 'global spam'
        
    spam = 'test spam'
    do_local()
    print('after local assignment:', spam)
    do_nonlocal()
    print('after nonlocal assignment:', spam)
    do_global()
    print('after global assignment:', spam)
    
scope_test()
print('in global scope:', spam)

#Note how the local assignment (which is default) didnâ€™t change scope_test's binding of spam. The nonlocal assignment changed scope_test's binding of spam, and the global assignment changed the module-level binding.

#You can also see that there was no previous binding for spam before the global assignment.
